# Gender Recognition by Voice Data

## Introduction
This repository is the final project for Math 2820 Lab (Intro to Probability and Statistic). Cooperate with 
Kenny Li and Alex DiCesare.

This database was created to identify a voice as male or female, based upon acoustic properties of the voice and speech. The dataset consists of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers. The voice samples are pre-processed by acoustic analysis in R using the seewave and tuneR packages, with an analyzed frequency range of 0hz-280hz

Data obtain from Kaggle, [GenderRecognitionByVoice](https://www.kaggle.com/primaryobjects/voicegender).
